# Gradle Kotlin DSL 1.0 RC13 Release Notes

Gradle Kotlin DSL 1.0 RC13 brings Kotlin 1.3.0 RC4, fixes to issues identified since 1.0 RC6, API/DSL refinements and enables the script compilation build cache.

In order to benefit from the best user experience, please update IntelliJ IDEA to 2018.3 EAP, Android Studio to 3.2 and their Kotlin Plugin to the latest 1.3 EAP (`1.3.0-rc-190` at the time of this writing).

Thanks to a great help from the community, the [Gradle User Manual](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-rc-1/userguide/userguide.html) now contains samples for both the Groovy and Kotlin DSLs. This is now the best place to find information on how to use the Gradle Kotlin DSL as it covers all Gradle features from [using plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-rc-1/userguide/plugins.html) to [customizing the dependency resolution behavior](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-rc-1/userguide/customizing_dependency_resolution_behavior.html).

A new user manual chapter dedicated to the [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-rc-1/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) has also been added.

This release contains potential breaking changes, see below.

v1.0-RC13 is included in Gradle 5.0 RC1.

To use it, upgrade your Gradle wrapper in the following fashion:

    $ cd $YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT
    $ gradle wrapper --gradle-version 5.0-rc-1 --distribution-type all

## Updates since v1.0-RC12

* **Upgrade embedded Kotlin to 1.3.0-RC4** ([#1197](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1197))

    Note that Gradle Kotlin DSL 1.0 will ship with Kotlin 1.3 GA.

* **Faster script compilation** ([#1168](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1168), [#817](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/817), [#TODO](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/TODO))

    The biggest bottleneck in the Gradle Kotlin DSL was the compilation of the generated Kotlin type-safe accessors during script compilation. The most impacted use cases were first time use of a build, and, the feedback loop when making changes to the build logic, both from the command line or in the script editor.
    
    In this release we replaced the usage of the Kotlin compiler by generating the bytecode directly instead. The generated accessors are quite simple and repetitive, no need for a full-blown compiler to produce their bytecode.
   
    The IDE experience is preserved, you can still display accessors documentation in context and navigate to their sources.

    First time use of a 500 projects build with simple build logic went from 83s down to YYs. That's a ZZ% improvement.
    
    TODO including nice graphs!
    
    Clean checkout of that same build went from 8s down to YYs. That's a ZZ% improvement.

    TODO including nice graphs!

    The effect is even more drastic on the build logic change feedback loop. On the same 500 projects build, making an API change in `buildSrc`, triggering the recompilation of all build scripts, went from 49s down to YYs . That's a ZZ% improvements.

    TODO including nice graphs!
    
    On the `gradle/gradle` build that has almost a hundred projects and a fairly complex build logic, the feedback loop on API change in `buildSrc` went from 54s down to YYs. That's a ZZ% improvements.

    TODO including nice graphs!
    
    All these measurements were done running the `tasks` task, configuring the whole build.
    
* **Fix script compilation build cache environment sensitivity** ([#1123](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1123))

    If you enable the [Gradle Build Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-rc-1/userguide/build_cache.html) then the Gradle Kotlin DSL will store and fetch the outputs of script compilation, avoiding the expensive work of recompiling them. This fix allows to reuse script compilation outputs between machines using different operating systems.

* **Fix Gradle daemon meta space leak caused by `kotlin-dsl` plugin** ([#1188](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1188))

    A permanent generation / meta space memory leak was introduced in 1.0 RC1 causing the Gradle daemon to consume spurious memory and eventually fail with `OutOfMemoryError`. This is now fixed. See the linked issue for the tasty details.

* **IDE script resolver skip buildSrc verification tasks** ([#1174](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1174))

    In order to shorten the feedback loop in the `.gradle.kts` editor, the script dependencies resolver now skips all verification tasks from the `buildSrc` build if present.

* **Generate compilable container elements accessors for element with type in the default package** ([#1158](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1158), [#1162](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1162), [#1164](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1164))

    Previous release introduced type-safe accessors for elements of containers (e.g. `tasks.compileJava { }`) but they were not compilable and caused builds to fail when the element type was from the default package. This is now fixed.  

For the complete list see the `gradle/kotlin-dsl` issues for [1.0-RC13](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A1.0-RC13+is%3Aclosed+).

## Updates since v1.0-RC6

* **Upgrade embedded Kotlin to 1.3.0-RC2** ([#1149](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1149), [#1005](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1005), [#1112](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1112), [#1125](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1125), [#1132](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1132))
    
    Note that Gradle Kotlin DSL 1.0 will ship with Kotlin 1.3 GA.

* **Script compilation build cache is now enabled alongside the Gradle Build Cache** ([#1152](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1152))

    If you enable the [Gradle Build Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-rc-1/userguide/build_cache.html) then the Gradle Kotlin DSL will store and fetch the outputs of script compilation, avoiding the expensive work of recompiling them.

* **Accessors for plugins present in `buildSrc`** ([#1156](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1156))

    You can now refer statically to plugins declared in `buildSrc`. Instead of:
    
    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        id("my.buildSrc.plugin.ID")
    }
    ```
    
    you can now write:
    
    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        my.buildSrc.plugin.ID
    }
    ```

* **Accessors for elements of collections** ([#879](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/879), [#1041](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1041))

    It is now possible to refer to elements of collections available at build script body compilation time via type-safe accessors. This is applied to `configurations`, `tasks` and all Gradle extensions that are collections such as `sourceSets`. For `tasks`, it means that instead of writing:

    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        java
    }
  
    tasks {
        named<Test>("test") {
            testLogging.showStacktraces = true
        }
    }
    ``` 

    you can now write:

    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        java
    }
  
    tasks {
        test {
            testLogging.showStacktraces = true
        }
    }
    ``` 

* **Accessors for artifact configurations in `configurations {}`** ([#1118](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1118), [#1129](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1129))

    Accessors for artifact configurations were missing in the `configurations {}` block. This has been fixed the same way as for all collections, see above. Instead of:
    
    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        java
    }

    configurations {
        named("implementation") {
            exclude(group = "org.foo")
        }
    }
    ```

    you can now write:

    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        java
    }

    configurations {
        implementation {
            exclude(group = "org.foo")
        }
    }
    ```

* **Refine dependency constraints DSL** ([#710](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/710), [#1091](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1091))

    Accessors for artifact configurations were missing in the `dependencies { constraints {} }` block. This has been fixed. Instead of:

    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        java
    }

    dependencies {
        constraints {
            add("implementation", "com.google.collections:google-collections") {
                version { rejectAll() }
                because("Google collections is superceded by Guava")
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    you can now write:

    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        java
    }

    dependencies {
        constraints {
            implementation("com.google.collections:google-collections") {
                version { rejectAll() }
                because("Google collections is superceded by Guava")
            }
        }
    }
    ```

* **Refine containers API** ([#1042](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1042), [#1104](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1104), [#1108](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1108), [#1116](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1116))

    During the RC phase, several discrepancies were found in the domain object collections and containers API. Special care has been taken to iron it in this release. Please see the linked issues for more information.

* **Let the `kotlin-dsl` plugin configure precompiled script plugins support** ([#1135](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1135))

    Applying the `kotlin-dsl` plugin now also applies the `kotlin-dsl-precompiled-script-plugins` plugin. See the [Gradle Kotlin DSL Primer](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-rc-1/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) chapter of the Gradle User Manual for more information. 

* **Refine IDE script dependencies resolver** ([#1133](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1133), [#1124](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1124), [#1139](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1139))

    The dependencies resolver backing IDE editors for `.gradle.kts` scripts has been refined to emit warnings only when necessary and display actionable messages. Please see the linked issues for more information.

For the complete list see the `gradle/kotlin-dsl` issues for [1.0-RC12](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A1.0-RC12+is%3Aclosed+).

## Breaking changes

This release contains some potential breaking changes:

* **Upgrade embedded Kotlin to 1.3.0-RC4**

    Kotlin DSL 1.0-rc-13 ships with Kotlin 1.3 RC4 (`1.3.0-rc-190`) which is only available via the [`kotlin-eap` repository](https://dl.bintray.com/kotlin/kotlin-eap/).
    Usually, that would mean that in order to use the `kotlin-dsl` plugin or the embedded Kotlin plugin version, the `kotlin-eap` repository would have to be added to `settings.pluginManagement.repositories`
    and `allprojects.repositories`. With the intent of making it easier to try, Kotlin DSL 1.0-rc-13 does it automatically for any project that includes a `settings.gradle.kts`.
    This behaviour will be removed once Kotlin 1.3 GA is available.

* **Artifact configuration accessors are now typed `NamedDomainObjectProvider<Configuration>`**

    Instead of simply `Configuration`. This goes in line with the fact that the Kotlin DSL sugar embrace the new configuration avoidance APIs. 

* **Legacy support for project schema JSON snapshot is removed** ([#1195](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1195))

    The legacy support for generating type-safe accessors from a JSON snapshot of multi-project schema and its companion task `:kotlinDslAccessorsSnapshot` have been removed. If your build contains a `gradle/project-schema.json` file you can safely delete it, it is no longer needed.

* **Rename `PluginAware.apply<T>(to)` to `PluginAware.applyTo<T>(target)`** ([#1161](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1161), [#1184](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1184))

    The `PluginAware.apply<T>(to)` extension function was causing ambiguities with `PluginAware.apply(plugin = "some.id")` and surprising behavior.
    
    This release renames that extension function to `PluginAware.applyTo<T>(target)` removing the ambiguity. If you were using that extension then use the new name instead.

## Avoiding Gradle Kotlin DSL internal APIs

Use of Kotlin DSL internal APIs in plugins and build scripts has the potential to break builds when either Gradle or plugins change.

The Kotlin DSL extends the [Gradle public API definition](https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-rc-1/userguide/authoring_maintainable_build_scripts.html#sec:avoiding_gradle_internal_apis) with `org/gradle/kotlin/dsl/*` excluding any subpackages.
